ðŸ˜„ Hello, I'm Christian Stone. This is where I'll be sharing certain data projects I've worked on. I'm, passionate about the use of data to solve problems and raise questions and feel as if it is a key component in any industry, or at least could be. At current I specialise in designing Excel-based reporting tools and dashboards for company-wide distribution. My work focuses on automation and clarity - Using Excel to its full potential, including pivot tables, Power Query, dynamic charts, VBA and structured formulas.

ðŸ”­ This portfolio is a mix of personal projects, case studies and real-world applications. Some are business-focused, others aren't - But each has been an opportunity to build, learn and develop my skills.

      -Excel
        -VBA
        -Power Query
      -Power BI
